# images-to-markdown
Take a list of images and create a markdown or html page with the file names

I like watching martial arts, pilates or other educational videos. I document the techiques by taking images from the videos and saving them with a description of what is happening in the action.

This little program takes the images of a directiory and creates a markdown or html file with the contents.
